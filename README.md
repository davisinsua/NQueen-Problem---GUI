NQueen Problem - GUI
========================
Created by : Davis Insua

ABOUT 
----------------

This is a Java applciation that solves the NQueen problem for a given N (within specified range), and presents a new window with the solution as a graphic. The application uses helper fucntions to identify which spaces the queen cannot be attacked (sharing a row, column or diagonal with another queen) and converts this to a GUI output. The program utilizes the JavaFX applciation platform for the UI elements, an adaptive interface that adjusts to the solved NQueen output, and the ArrayList datastructrue + nested loops to efficiently set up the solution graphic for viewing.

USAGE 
----------------

The application is used by typing in the desired square chess board size N into the text field, clicking solve, and viewing the output.

DEMO ANIMATIONS
